# Project Overview & Mission

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), a world renowned frontend javascript framework with [Vue](https://vuejs.org)

This project aims to help students solve troubles with homework by creating a homework solving app with AI (Artificial Intelligence) capabilities.

## Project Contents

← `index.html`: The home screen, it imports the src/implementhome.jsx for the UI (User Interface)

← `src/`: This folder contains all the files React uses to build Rocketspace Homework.

### Working in the `src/` folder 📁

← `src/implementhome.jsx`: The place where you place stylesheets and more for the main page before it gets to the html page / browser.

← `src/implementcalc.jsx`: The same as implementhome.jsx just for the calculator page.

← `src/pages/`: This folder contains the barebones jsx UI (User Interface) for the page.

← `src/styles`: A dedicated folder to hold CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) files.

### The src/pages/ folder 📁

← `src/pages/home.jsx`: The barebones UI for index.html

← `src/pages/calculator.jsx`: The same thing as src/pages/home.jsx just for calculator.html

← `src/pages/solvedEquation.jsx`: A react component that is imported after the initial page load. It is currently a work in progress.
